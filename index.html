   <h2>Lesson 1.3 - Wednesday 30th September 2020</h2> <!--h2 is a heading with the highest importance-->


    
   <p>Today we learnt how to clone our respositories from Github within a browser, onto the Github Desktop application. </p> 
    
    <p>I was pleased the class all learn at different rates as it makes me feel more comfortable about asking questions and repeating directions.
        When demos were repeated over it gave me the opportunity to check over my work, add to my notes, or check on the dog on the baby camera! 
        </p>
    <p>We have also learnt how to open the project on Visual Code Studio, as well as how to search and install extensions that should help us on our coding journey. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Part 2 - Takeaway task (aka Homework!)</h2>
    
    <p>I'm using VSCode (Visual Studio Code) now, on my desktop to alter this CPD.txt and add to today's reflection and practise what I have learnt today. 
        I think I have got the hang of Repositories, how to create and delete, but I will just practise one more time. 
        Okay... I've made one in the Github browser called TEST...now checking Github Desktop...it's not there... i need to clone it to the Desktop App i think... 
        Yes... so on the Browser I've gone to the green "Code" button and selected "Open with Github Desktop".
        Hurray! It is in my Github destop app. </p>
    
    <p>Now to delete it. 
        Firstly on the Web App.. Opened respository..TEST...clicked settings... scroll to bottom and "Delete this Repository".. then confirm in the dialogue box that has just popped up. 
        Excellent! deleted. 
        (Also I can now see that Luke our tutor has just created a Foo Fighters Tribute page... LOL :) )</p>
    
    
        <p>Now checking Github Desktop...I pressed refresh and it told me TEST respository does not exist anymore.. this is good news. 
    I've right clicked on the list of repositories on the left to remove and that seems to have worked. 
    Ace, i've done it!</p>
    
    <p>Today's lesson was also really useful to build up a bank of resources we can use to support our learning, for example the phone apps. I'm going to share these with my nephews (7 and 10) because I think they'll be really interested, and we can all learn together. 
    </p>
    <p>Okay, now to save and commit changes etc etc.... wish me luck!</p>

    <h2>Lesson 1.4 - Thursday 1st October 2020</h2>

    <p>In today's lesson we first learnt about how Github can be used for single and developer workflows, so that collaborators can work on the same project simultaneously. Seems a bit like when more than one person uses a google doc at the same time ?  </p>
<p> Secondly, we learnt how to create a html file. It really doesn't seem as hard as you might think, simply changing the file suffix, for example from ".txt" to ".html". </p>
    
    <p>Along with this we did plenty of practise of making changes to the document, then 1. using VSC to Save, 2. Opening Github Desktop, 3. Making a note of amendments, 4. Commiting to Master, 5. Push to Origin, 6. Checking on Github Browser. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER ! </p>

    <p>It's important stuff also and also helped illustrate to us the way Github uses Git as a version control system. We talked a lot about branches also, so that Master branches can continue to be live while developers can work on a clone of the same version to test bugs, new features etc etc. I think it made sense, but might try watch some youtubes to understand better.</p>
    <p> Also, Luke talked about how there are 2 ways to use Git; using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and the Graphic User Interface (GUI). I don't think I was paying attention properly when we used the CLI before so again might try and reinforce my understanding of CLI and GUI. </p>

    <p>I'm making this update Friday, after the advice "code everyday!". Tomorrow I'll try do a little more, or watch those YouTubes or something to keep my mind on track :) </p>

<!--need to put in Monday's reflection-->
    <h2>Lesson 2.1 - Monday 6th October 2020</h2>
    <p>Reading through last week's reflections, all that seems to have sunk in. </p>
    <p>I watched the Youtube links we were given for a Takeaway task about the differences between HTML, CSS and Javascript. I really like the 2 analogies that help understand it </p>
    <ol> 
        <li>Html being the skeleton, CSS the clothes, hair style, style, and Javascript as the functions</li>
        <br/>
        <img width="400px" src="https://i.ibb.co/vz4pZcJ/Screenshot-2020-10-06-at-20-35-10.png" alt="html is a skeleton, CSS the clothes, hair style, style, and Javascript as the functions">
        <br/> 
        <br/>
        <li>Html being the builder, CSS the artist, hair style, style, and Javascript as the wizard</li>
        <br/>

    <br/> </ol>
<p> In the lesson we learnt about different elements that can be used in HTML</p>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph</li>
<li>Heading</li>
<li>Link</li>
<li>Div</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Title</li>
</ul>
<p>...and 99% of the time these need both an <strong>opening tag</strong> tag and a <strong>closing tag</strong> </p>

<p>Other useful HTML to note include</p>
<ul>
    <li> < strong > makes text strong < / strong > </strong></li>
    <li> < em > emphasises text by making italic < / em > </li>
<p>...both of which are really useful to use for accesibility and screenreaders. </p>

<p>We also discussed Container elements (ones with an opening and closing tag eg. paragraph ) and Stand alone elements (ones without a closing tag, eg < / br >   </p>

<p>
    Tasks we did involved practising nesting code, understanding attibutes, opening links in new tabs and mailer clients and using images. I was pretty comfortable undestanding it all, it just needs ingraining into my brain a bit more  &#128512; I could definitely code something using what we've learnt, I'd just need to refer to my notes! (hey look i put an emoji in!! &#128526 &#9996)

    <!--Tuesday's reflection-->
    <h2>Lesson 2.2 - Tuesday 7th October 2020</h2>
    <p> Today we got more into CSS which is exciting! I went to town a bit and tried to practise an example of each element on task-2.2.2.html 
        We learnt about how most developers prefer to have CSS files separate, which makes total sense. Again I can draw simularities to using Indesign. If you were using Word you'd put your images in the document, which would be inefficient and bulky. By linking to images, they can be used for a number of documents - much like linking a CSS file into a html one. It also makes sense from a branding and efficiency point of view. If a company decided to suddely change the font used on the website, it could be changed easily on the CSS without having to find and replace on multiple html files. 
    </p>
    <p>When practising the syntax, I've noticed I sometimes I forget to put the semicolon at the end of the value. But hopefully this will become automated, like when you put a full stop at the end of a sentence ! I like the way in class that we get told what we're doing, then do it together. However sometimes I feel like we could put all the examples into one sheet instead of going through waiting for everyone to create a new sheet. Alternatively, we could set up X number of sheets in advance ready for the class. But I understand I need to wait for others and sometimes I understand concepts quicker. So i'll be patient!  </p>
    
    <!--Wednesdays's reflection-->
    <h2>Lesson 2.3 - Wednesday 8th October 2020</h2>
    <p> In the lesson today we got to grips with the CSS a bit more. We learnt about IDs and Classes, and why they're called "CASCADING" style sheets. It's a very similar principle to using Paragraph styles in InDesign, so I think i caught on easily. Or like painting by numbers, it's like in the html you have a code word, and you have to go to the CSS file for the key to explain what that means to do.</p>
    <p> <strong>I need to remember to look up Html entities</strong>. An example of this is like using a symbol like a copyright, and there's a secret code way to write it in html, instead of fanny-ing about trying to google, copy and paste it, which is what i'd usually do !</p> 
<p>Learning that different elements are either block or inline was interesting, that's something I didn't know. I'm not sure if I'll just get in the practise of which are inline and which are block, or whether I should try and learn them? </p>
<p>Using 'div's is something I've come across before, but I think this class explained it better. I get that they're an umberella / bracket /bubble around some bits, so you can style a whole section, i think ? for example, a header is essentially a div, it just has a special name because it's used so commonly. Practising the text align, with divs, classes and IDs I think would be really useful to get the hang of them properly.We quickly covered SPAN as well, but I think my brain had gone by then - so that's another thing for the to do list!  </p>
