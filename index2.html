   <h1>Lesson 3 - Wednesday 30th September 2020</h1> <!--h1 is a heading with the highest importance-->

   <h2>Reflection</h2> 
    
   <p>Today we learnt how to clone our respositories from Github within a browser, onto the Github Desktop application. </p> 
    
    <p>I was pleased the class all learn at different rates as it makes me feel more comfortable about asking questions and repeating directions.
        When demos were repeated over it gave me the opportunity to check over my work, add to my notes, or check on the dog on the baby camera! 
        </p>
    <p>We have also learnt how to open the project on Visual Code Studio, as well as how to search and install extensions that should help us on our coding journey. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Part 2 - Takeaway task (aka Homework!)</h2>
    
    <p>I'm using VSCode (Visual Studio Code) now, on my desktop to alter this CPD.txt and add to today's reflection and practise what I have learnt today. 
        I think I have got the hang of Repositories, how to create and delete, but I will just practise one more time. 
        Okay... I've made one in the Github browser called TEST...now checking Github Desktop...it's not there... i need to clone it to the Desktop App i think... 
        Yes... so on the Browser I've gone to the green "Code" button and selected "Open with Github Desktop".
        Hurray! It is in my Github destop app. </p>
    
    <p>Now to delete it. 
        Firstly on the Web App.. Opened respository..TEST...clicked settings... scroll to bottom and "Delete this Repository".. then confirm in the dialogue box that has just popped up. 
        Excellent! deleted. 
        (Also I can now see that Luke our tutor has just created a Foo Fighters Tribute page... LOL :) )</p>
    
    
        <p>Now checking Github Desktop...I pressed refresh and it told me TEST respository does not exist anymore.. this is good news. 
    I've right clicked on the list of repositories on the left to remove and that seems to have worked. 
    Ace, i've done it!</p>
    
    <p>Today's lesson was also really useful to build up a bank of resources we can use to support our learning, for example the phone apps. I'm going to share these with my nephews (7 and 10) because I think they'll be really interested, and we can all learn together. 
    </p>
    <p>Okay, now to save and commit changes etc etc.... wish me luck!</p>
