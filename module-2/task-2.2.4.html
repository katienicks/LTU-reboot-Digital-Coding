    <p>You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
        When I met you</p>
        <p> I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
        <strong>Turned you into someone new</strong></p>
        <p>  Now five years later on, you've got the <em>world at your feet</em>
        Success has been so easy for you</p>
        <p> But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
        And I can put you back down too</p>
